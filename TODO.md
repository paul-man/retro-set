- [ ] Render each setlist out separately, displaying relevant concert date information (date, tour name, supporting artists, sold out, # of songs, etc.)
  - [ ] Add button to each setlist letting user pick that to search spotify for (eventually change this to checkboxes for creating multiple playlists at a time)
- [ ] Allow user to double check results of Spotify Track Search, showing all options letting the user pick and choose how to handle duplicate matches
- [x] New favicon (can do better)
- [ ] Create view component to hold Spotify widget
  - [ ] Add loading overlay
- [ ] Improve band/venue/song searching
  - [ ] might have to abandon libraries and make calls "manually"
- [x] Stop unexpected search for artist/venue after user has chosen from dropdown
- [ ] Create spotify login (http://jsfiddle.net/JMPerez/62wafrm7/)
- [ ] Improve song searching
  - Properly encode song/artist names
  - Filter out obvious false positives (artist name in track data doesn't match)
  - Create warning on songs with collisions (do this in new component [[vue-slideout-panel](https://github.com/officert/vue-slideout-panel)])
    - Warning can be clicks and show scrollable modal(?) with song/album name and album artwork
      - Each song in list will have button to select
- [ ] Fix display of setlists pre Spotify search
