spotify login plan of action:
- before each route load check is state has user.token
- if yes:
  - go ahead and load, displaying username
- if no:
  - redirect them to something like '/spotify-login/
  - have a spotify login button
  - clicking that redirects them to the normal spotify login page (calls our spotify auth route)
  - once the click agree/login it calls the node callback
  - we redirect them to the auth page passing the user.token and save it in the state
