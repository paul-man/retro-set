# RetroSet

Find setlists from passed concerts and turn them into spotify playlists!

_____

## SetListFM API

Using this API we are able to search for venues and music artists and show a list of all songs they've played there before.

Once we have this, we can separate the lists into the music arists' different performance dates at the venue in the correct order they were played.

## Spotify API

Once we have the music artist and the setlist of song names, we can attempt to search Spotify for the songs and add them to a playlist.
